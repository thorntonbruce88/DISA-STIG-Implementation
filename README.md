### Step 2) Mock Meeting: Policy Buy-In (Stakeholders)

Mock Project: Remediation Policy Rollout Meeting

üìÖ Date: (Mock date)

üë• Attendees: Josh, Jimmy

üìù Meeting Type: Policy Draft Review (Security Remediation Program)

üìñ Meeting Recap 

This morning, Josh and Jimmy held a focused meeting to review the draft Remediation Policy. Jimmy confirmed that the draft was well-structured but raised a concern: with current staffing levels, the proposed 48-hour remediation requirement for critical vulnerabilities would be difficult to achieve.

Josh acknowledged this challenge and proposed a compromise ‚Äî extending the remediation window for most critical vulnerabilities to one week, while reserving the 48-hour window exclusively for urgent, high-impact zero-day threats. Jimmy agreed that this adjustment was practical and supported operational feasibility.

Additionally, Jimmy requested a grace period during the initial rollout to allow teams time to adapt. Josh confirmed that once the policy is finalized, all departments will have a six-month adjustment period before strict enforcement begins.

The meeting concluded on a positive note, with both parties emphasizing the value of collaboration and expressing appreciation for being included in the decision-making process.

üîë Key Highlights

Issue Identified: Current staffing cannot meet a strict 48-hour remediation requirement.

Compromise Reached:

1 week for standard critical vulnerabilities.

48 hours reserved for zero-day vulnerabilities only.

Transition Period: Six months of adjustment after policy finalization before enforcement.

Outcome: Agreement reached with a collaborative, solution-oriented approach.

Tone of Meeting: Short, effective, and inclusive ‚Äî ensuring all departments feel part of the solution.

‚úÖ Outcome

The team reached a balanced agreement that ensures security standards remain strong while also accounting for staffing realities. This compromise not only improves adoption feasibility but also fosters stronger collaboration across departments.

### Step 4) Mock Meeting: Initial Scan Permission (Server Team)

Vulnerability Scan Kickoff Meeting

üìÖ Date: (Mock date)

üë• Attendees: Josh, Jimmy

üìù Meeting Type: Security Operations Discussion

üìñ Meeting Recap 

This morning, Josh and Jimmy met to discuss the kickoff of vulnerability scanning under the newly implemented Vulnerability Management Policy. Josh explained the plan to conduct weekly credentialed scans across the server infrastructure, estimating that scanning all 2,200 assets would take approximately 4‚Äì6 hours.

Jimmy raised valid concerns regarding resource utilization during scans and the security risks of providing administrative credentials to all systems. Josh clarified that the scan engine generates test traffic to assess vulnerabilities, including checks for outdated software, insecure protocols, and weak cipher suites. He also emphasized that scans should not cause downtime.

To address these concerns, both parties agreed to start with a single-server test scan to observe system performance. For credentials, Josh suggested a just-in-time access approach, where temporary Active Directory accounts are enabled only during scans and then disabled immediately afterward. Jimmy agreed and committed to having Susan begin work on automation for account provisioning to streamline this process.

The meeting concluded with agreement on a phased rollout, starting with a pilot scan, and a plan to reconvene once the credentials are prepared.

üîë Key Highlights

Plan: Weekly credentialed vulnerability scans across ~2,200 assets.

Duration Estimate: 4‚Äì6 hours per full scan cycle.

Concerns Raised:

Potential server performance impact.

Risks of providing broad admin access.

Mitigations:

Start with a single-server scan as a test.

Use temporary Active Directory accounts (just-in-time access model).

Action Item: Susan to automate account provisioning workflow.

Outcome: Agreement to pilot the process before scaling to full infrastructure.

‚úÖ Outcome

The team aligned on a phased scanning approach that balances security requirements with operational safety. By piloting on a single server and using controlled, temporary credentials, the team ensures both confidence in the process and a smoother transition to organization-wide vulnerability management.

### Step 8) Mock Meeting: Post-Initial Discovery Scan (Server Team)

The server team reviewed vulnerability scan results, identifying outdated software, insecure accounts, and deprecated protocols. The remediation packages were prepared for submission to the Change Control Board (CAB). 

Mock Project: Post-Discovery Scan Review Meeting

üìÖ Date: (Mock date)

üë• Attendees: Josh, Jimmy

üìù Meeting Type: Security Vulnerability Review with Server Team

üìñ Meeting Recap 

Josh and Jimmy met to review the results of the initial discovery vulnerability scan across the server environment. Jimmy confirmed that the scans ran smoothly with no outages or noticeable performance issues, aside from the expected open connections. Both agreed that resource utilization would continue to be monitored, but no significant risks were anticipated.

Josh then presented the vulnerability findings. The most common issue stemmed from outdated Wireshark installations, which appeared across multiple servers. Additionally, Josh discovered that the local guest account was a member of the local administrators group, raising a serious configuration concern. Other findings included deprecated TLS protocols (1.0 and 1.1), medium-strength cipher suites, and some issues potentially resolved through routine Windows Updates (e.g., Edge Chromium updates). Self-signed certificates were noted but considered low priority.

Jimmy agreed that the major focus areas should be removing Wireshark, addressing insecure protocols and cipher suites, and removing the guest account from administrative groups. He noted that most servers share the same configuration baseline, meaning remediation should be more efficient.

The team also confirmed that patch management is already in place for Windows Updates, so vulnerabilities addressed through normal patch cycles were not a concern. Josh committed to building remediation packages for the server team and to return with recommendations ahead of the next Change Control Board meeting.

üîë Key Highlights

Scan Results:

No outages or major performance issues during the scan.

Monitoring confirmed minimal impact on server resources.

Findings:

Outdated Wireshark installations on multiple servers.

Guest account improperly assigned to local administrators group.

Deprecated TLS protocols (1.0 & 1.1) in use.

Medium-strength cipher suites detected.

Some vulnerabilities likely resolved by Windows Updates.

Self-signed certificates noted, low priority.

Next Steps:

Remove Wireshark from servers.

Remediate guest account group membership.

Disable insecure protocols and cipher suites.

Leverage existing patch management for update-related vulnerabilities.

Prepare remediation packages for streamlined deployment.

‚úÖ Outcome

The server team and security analyst reached alignment on the priority vulnerabilities requiring remediation. The phased approach‚Äîstarting with Wireshark removal, guest account fixes, and protocol hardening‚Äîensures that risks are addressed efficiently without operational disruption. Josh will prepare remediation packages and return with a proposal before the next Change Control Board session.

### Step 9) Mock CAB Meeting: Implementing Remediations

The Change Control Board (CAB) reviewed and approved the plan to remove insecure protocols and cipher suites. The plan included a rollback script and a tiered deployment approach.  

Mock Project: CAB Meeting ‚Äì Vulnerability Remediation Approval

üìÖ Date: (Mock date)

üë• Attendees: Change Advisory Board, Josh (Risk), Jimmy (Infrastructure)

üìù Meeting Type: Change Advisory Board (CAB) Review


üìñ Meeting Recap

During this week‚Äôs CAB meeting, the server team presented two planned vulnerability remediations: removal of insecure protocols and removal of insecure cipher suites. While Jimmy from the Infrastructure team was initially expected to provide the technical overview, he deferred to Josh from the Risk department, who had developed the remediation solution.

Josh explained that the issue stems from outdated or deprecated cryptographic protocols and cipher suites still being available on servers. If left enabled, these could allow systems to negotiate insecure connections. The solution involves a PowerShell script that updates the Windows registry, disabling weak protocols and ciphers while ensuring that only secure, modern standards remain enabled.

The CAB raised a key question regarding rollback planning. Josh confirmed that the team had designed a tiered deployment strategy (pilot ‚Üí pre-production ‚Üí full production) and also developed an automated rollback script to restore original settings if unexpected issues occur. This approach reassured the board that risks were mitigated and the change was safe to move forward.

The meeting concluded with no further objections, and the CAB approved the proposed remediation changes for deployment.

üîë Key Highlights

Planned Changes:

Disable insecure cryptographic protocols.

Disable deprecated cipher suites.

Technical Approach:

PowerShell scripts modify Windows registry keys.

Secure, modern algorithms enabled by default.

Risk Mitigation:

Tiered rollout strategy: pilot ‚Üí pre-production ‚Üí full deployment.

Automated rollback scripts provided for rapid recovery.

CAB Concerns Addressed:

Ensured rollback capability was available.

Verified change scope was limited to registry updates.

‚úÖ Outcome

The CAB approved the remediation plan, recognizing that the solution was low-risk, well-documented, and fully reversible. With rollback safeguards and phased deployment in place, the team is cleared to move forward with implementation.

### On-going Vulnerability Management (Maintenance Mode)

After the initial remediation cycle is complete, the Vulnerability Management Program enters Maintenance Mode. This phase focuses on sustaining long-term security by ensuring vulnerabilities are continuously identified, assessed, and remediated. Regular scanning, proactive monitoring, and timely patching are essential to keep systems protected. (See [Draft Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rR1T7eE6tPSDVPAePH8cSJmdbQcUT4nUcLwoehtlwMA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.r1jf4p1smpmc) for scanning and remediation cadence requirements.)

Key Activities in Maintenance Mode

Scheduled Vulnerability Scans: Run regular scans (weekly, monthly, or as required) to detect newly introduced vulnerabilities.

Patch Management: Apply security patches and updates consistently, ensuring critical vulnerabilities are addressed without delay.

Remediation Follow-ups: Resolve new findings quickly, prioritizing fixes based on severity and business impact.

Policy Review and Updates: Revisit and refine the Vulnerability Management Policy to reflect current security best practices and organizational requirements.

Audit and Compliance: Perform internal audits to confirm adherence to the policy and regulatory standards.

Stakeholder Communication: Maintain clear communication with IT and business teams responsible for remediation to ensure effective coordination.

By keeping the program active during Maintenance Mode, organizations strengthen their ability to stay ahead of emerging threats and maintain long-term security resilience.
